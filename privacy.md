# Privacy Policy
## How we process your data?

### Github

This website is powered by Jekyll and is hosted on GitHub.  Github can have full insight in visitor data, like connecting IP addresses, visited pages, etc. Note that Github is not known to actively profile visitors. By using a VPN you can (try to) prevent this

### Google Analytics

This website uses Google Analytics. This happens only if you approve third party cookies and scripts. 
However, we have taken following actions we can to limit the data collection power of Google:

1. We have enable IP anonymisation on Google Analytics
2. Use SSL at all time. 

## How to opt-out from Google Analytics?
#### Google Analytics opt-out browser add-on
You can install [Google Analytics Opt-out](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/google-analytics-opt-out/fllaojicojecljbmefodhfapmkghcbnh?hl=en) to your browser. This  add-on prevents the Google Analytics JavaScript (gtag.js, ga.js, analytics.js, and dc.js) that is running on websites from sharing information with Google Analytics about visit activity. 

However using the Google Analytics opt-out browser add-on will not prevent data from being sent to the website itself or analytics used by GitHub.
